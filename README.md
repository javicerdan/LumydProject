Proximity IM for Android using GAE, endpoints and GCM

Simple app that uses Google App Engine and Google Cloud Messaging to put you in contact with people nearby.


Initial commit.
App registers with GCM, sends your location to the App Engine server and the server responds with the people nearby. Buggy,
unpolished, unfinished. Hopefully it works if you are kind to it and wait enough time.
